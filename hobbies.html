            Code Geass 10/10 Best: Anime
            <p>
              Code Geass has the best ending of all time. Some fans don't like
              the second half as a lot of things are happening all at once but I
              like that aspect. This series is very political and about using
              humans piloting robots to win the war between two nations.

            Attack On Titan 10/10 Best: Action
            <p>
              Although I didn't watch it when it came out, this anime got so
              much hype in 2013. It onces again blew up when season 4 started. I
              think the story is unmatched as the plot reveals itself gradually
              after each episode. Opening 3 is my favorite as at first it wasn't
              as eye catching as opening 1 but slowly got addicting.

            <p>
              Steins;Gate is that anime that is on top of MyAnimeList but many
              watched it. Although slow at first, the mystery slowly unfolds as
              the story goes on because this is an anime about time travel. I
              was mindblown at the end, and this show is a very good mystery

            Fate/Zero 9.5/10 Best: Animation
            <p>
              Before Demon Slayer, the studio Ufotable animated the Fate series.
              This came out in 2011 but the animation still holds up
              tremendously in animation. Part 2 is much better than part 1 as
              everything finally happens, and Fate/Zero is better than it's
              sequel Fate/Stay Night. I heard the 3 Fate movies are top tier
              too.

            One Piece 9.5/10 Best: Long
            <p>
              I usually don't consider long running shounen shows to be a top 10
              caliber anime but One Piece is the exception. Defintely the early
              parts are rough but once you get past that, you'll be hooked for
              life since the world building is number 1, the manga is superior,
              the recent animation is top tier, and it's a long series with
              memorable moments.

              Because I didn't watch Gintama, Grand Blue is the funniest anime I

              college than it's "scuba diving" focus. There's a lot of

              I understand why people say it's carried by the animation because
              the animation is just that good but I still give props to the
              story. This show captures Japanese culture and gets better as the
              series goes on. The recent season is why I put it in front of
              Jujustsu Kaisen as both are very good.

            Haikyuu 9/10 Best: Sports
            <p>
              Haikyuu is the best sports anime because it gives attention to
              each character and doesn't make the action scenes over the top.
              Although it's predictable that the main team will always win, the
              series make you want to root for them and be invested in each
              match. My favorite player is Asashi. I didn't mind the animation
              change after season 3 but season 3 is still the serie's peak.

            Kaguya-sama: Love is War? 9/10 Best: Romance

              I'm suprised the series gets better each time and it's usually the
              same comedic feel. Love is confusing and can be like a game so I
              love the unique spin this funny anime has about who will confess

          I mainly play single player games because I get scared playing with

          better than the older generation because of updated mechanics and
          graphics. I currently own a PS5, RTX 3080 PC, Nintendo Switch, and
          Oculus Quest.

            Persona 5 Royal is the greatest game of all time. It has the
            greatest soundtrack ever, an anime, aesthetic visuals, and the best
            turn based combat. It improves upon the original game by fixing the
            guns, adding more story and characters, and making exploration more
            fun.

            This is the best game to play on PS5 with the best graphics, combat,
            and story. It improves upon the previous game by adding variety of
            bosses and locations, a deeper story, and more options to combat
            mainly characters and weapons. The skill tree is deep, there's a lot
            of customization, and I'm glad this is the final game to the
            franchise.

            Nintendo took a risk with BoTW and it definitely paid off in this
            open world setting. What I love about the game is that you can climb
            almost everywhere within your stamia ad can fight the final boss
            anytime. I did play on Wii U, didn't mind the voice acting, and
            story is simple and straight forward.

            There will probably be no VR game that will be better than Valve's.
            You can see that the game felt complete in length and dedication
            since VR games are either short or based off of non VR ones. The
            gauntlet to pull any objects fall away, the gunplay, and the visual
            are all top tier here.

            This game is the accumulation of all the games FromSoftware has
            made. There's so much to discover in the open world and each boss
            fight is intense as ever. I played the Astrologer class with a mix
            between range spells and melee weapons.

            So many characters and mechanics have been added and optimized for
            the 4th installment of the franchise. Compared to traditional
            fighting games, it's very easy for anyone to play especially in a
            group setting. The added story mode, dlc, and multiplayer are all
            compelling additions to Smash Ultimate.

            Super Mario Odyssey Best:

            </p>
            Although TLoZ BoTW is better, Super Mario Odyssey is up there and is
            the embodiment of fun. The art style is timeless, the cap brings new
            ways to transverse, and each world is distinct. It's pretty easy and
            combat can only reach a limit but playing it casually is satisfying
            enough.

            Red Dead Redemption 2 Best: Graphics

            </p>
            This is the most realistic graphics ever and there's so much thought
            into it because it's RockStar Games. The story is very intersting an
            a cowboy setting and a plot about a group slowly falling apart. The
            game can be a bit too slow in everywthing but does add to the
            realism and the scope of the environment.
