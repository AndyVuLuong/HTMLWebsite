    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Code Geass
        <p>
          Code Geass has the best ending of all time. Some fans don't like the
          second half as a lot of things are happening all at once but I like
          that aspect. This series is very political and about using humans
          piloting robots to win the war between two nations.

      <li>
        Attack On Titan
        <p>
          Although I didn't watch it when it came out, this anime got so much
          hype in 2013. It onces again blew up when season 4 started. I think
          the story is unmatched as the plot reveals itself gradually after each
          episode. Opening 3 is my favorite as at first it wasn't as eye
          catching as opening 1 but slowly got addicting.

      </li>
      <li>
        Steins;Gate
        <p>
          Steins;Gate is that anime that is on top of MyAnimeList but many
          watched it. Although slow at first, the mystery slowly unfolds as the
          story goes on because this is an anime about time travel. I was
          mindblown at the end, and this show is a very good mystery anime.

      </li>
      <li>Fate/Zero</li>
      <p>
        Before Demon Slayer, the studio Ufotable animated the Fate series. This
        came out in 2011 but the animation still holds up tremendously in
        animation. Part 2 is much better than part 1 as everything finally
        happens, and Fate/Zero is better than it's sequel Fate/Stay Night. I
        heard the 3 Fate movies are top tier too.

      <li>
        One Piece
        <p>
          I usually don't consider long running shounen shows to be a top 10
          caliber anime but One Piece is the exception. Defintely the early
          parts are rough but once you get past that, you'll be hooked for life
          since the world building is number 1, the manga is superior, the
          recent animation is top tier, and it's a long series with memorable
          moments.

      </li>
      <li>Grand Blue</li>
      <p>
        Because I didn't watch Gintama, Grand Blue is the funniest anime I ever
        watched. It is literally about drinking and partying in college than
        it's "scuba diving" focus. There's a lot of misunderstandings and the
        manga is very good too.

      <li>
        Demon Slayer
        <p>
          I understand why people say it's carried by the animation because the
          animation is just that good but I still give props to the story. This
          show captures Japanese culture and gets better as the series goes on.
          The recent season is why I put it in front of Jujustsu Kaisen as both
          are very good.

      </li>
      <li>
        Haikyuu
        <p>
          Haikyuu is the best sports anime because it gives attention to each
          character and doesn't make the action scenes over the top. Although
          it's predictable that the main team will always win, the series make
          you want to root for them and be invested in each match. My favorite
          player is Asashi. I didn't mind the animation change after season 3
          but season 3 is still the serie's peak.

      </li>
      <li>Kaguya-sama: Love is War?</li>
      <p>
        I'm suprised the series gets better each time and it's usually the same
        comedic feel. Love is confusing and can be like a game so I love the
        unique spin this funny anime has about who will confess first.

      <li>
        Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
        <p>
          FMAB is considered the best anime of all time on the web but it's
          isn't that high for me. Every opening is good, the ending is up there,
          and it's consistently solid throughout with a mix of action, comedy,
          and drama in a military setting.

      <h1>Video Games</h1>
      <p>
        I mainly play single player games because I get scared playing with
        other people online. I tend to think current generation games are better
        than the older generation because of updated mechanics and graphics. I
        currenly own a PS5, RTX 3080 PC, Nintendo Switch, and Oculus Quest.
