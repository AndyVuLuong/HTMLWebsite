    <h3>
      Courses</h3>
      <p>
        The main courses for Computer Science are: 
        <ul>
      <li>CS 146 - Data Structures and Algorithms <p>This is the first class you take once you finish CS 46B. Many professors
        taught this course, and it introduces data structures like LinekdList, Hashmap, and Queue and alogirthms
        like searches, sorts, and trees. <br>

      </p></li>
      <li>CS 147 - Computer Architecture <p>I took this class at Mission College. <br> <a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-147-Computer-Architecture" target="_blank">CS 147 GitHub</a>
      </p></li>
      <li>CS 149 - Operating Systems <p><a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-149-Operating-Systems" target="_blank">CS 149 GitHub</a></p></li>
      <li>CS 151 - Object-Oriented Design <p><a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-151-Object-Oriented-Design" target="_blank">CS 151 GitHub</a></p> </li>
      <li>CS 152 - Programming Paradigms <p>I was most confused in this class becaues it introduces various languages that you
        probably wouldn't use ever like Lex, Yac, and Prolog. In this class, <br> <a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-152-Programming-Paradigms" target="_blank">CS 152 GitHub</a>
      </p></li>
      <li>CS 154 - Formal Languages and Computability 
        <p>This class is the harder version of Discrete Math. My professor was David Taylor, who decided that your grade is only determined by exams as any homework and quizzes are supposed
          to help prepare you for the exam. I think this class was the hardest as it's very abstract but the overall percentage to pass 
          is around 50% and he curves enough. <br> <a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-154-Formal-Languages-and-Computability" target="_blank">CS 154 GitHub</a>
        </p></li>
      <li>CS 157A - Introduction to Database Management Systems <p><a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-157A-Introduction-to-Database-Management-Systems" target="_blank">CS 157A GitHub</a></p> </li>
      <li>CS 160 - Software Engineering <p>I'm currently taking this course in my last semester of college. <br> <a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-160-Software-Engineering" target="_blank">CS 160 GitHub</a></p></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Other courses I would like to hightlight are:
        <ul>
          <li>CS 46B - Introduction to Data Structures<p>You need to pass this class in order to sign up to most of the main courses above. Only one professor taught this class so 
            basically every students in your grade was either in that class or the other. I'm glad that it included a useful project that students can put on their resume.

          <li>CS 156 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence<p> This class used python and either Jupiter Notebook or Google Colab to run .ipynb machine learning.<br><a href="https://github.com/AndyVuLuong/CS-156-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence" target="_blank">CS 156 GitHub</a></p></li>
          <li>MATH 42 - Discrete Mathematics</li>
          <li>COMM 20 - Public Speaking</li>
          <li>JPN 1A - Elementary Japanese</li>
          <li>GEOL 4L - Earth Systems Lab</li>
        
        </ul>
