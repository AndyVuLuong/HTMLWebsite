          <li>Overview: First from the catalog: Programming language syntax and semantics. Data types and type checking. Scope, bindings, and environments. Functional and logic programming paradigms, and comparison to other paradigms. Extensive coverage of a functional language. At a high level, a programming language is a formal language for telling a computer to do something. This class studies the design and implementation of programming languages. To formalize a programming language, we need to say what strings of characters constitute a valid program. This is called the syntax of the language. We will look at techniques to specify syntax using regular expressions and context free grammars. The next step in specifying a language is choosing what the core building blocks for a program should be and what those building blocks should mean. Semantics is a fancy word for meaning. To specify language semantics for almost any programming language, you need to be able to say how variables work. So we will look at how to specify the space of
            possible values a variable is allowed to have (its type), how assignment of variables to values works (binding), how to check if value is bound to variable is of the correct type (type checking), and what variables are visible to the running program at any given point in its execution (visibility and environment). Beyond variables, we will look historically at what building blocks that have been considered in the past to create a programming language and what were their pro's and con's. Two important types of programming languages functional languages and logic programming languages will be discussed. Finally, we describe what it takes to write a program that takes as input a string in programming language and then outputs a sequence of low level instructions for the computer (machine code). I.e., a compiler or interpreter. We will consider top-down and bottom-up compilers/interpreters with an emphasis on the latter.
          </li>
          <li>Anecdote: I was most confused in this class becaues it introduces various languages that you
            probably wouldn't use ever like Lex, Yac, and Prolog. In this class,</li>

          <li>Overview: To introduce students to the basic concepts of theoretical computer science, and to show them that many of the origins of these questions came from some very practical considerations.
            Topics covered will include context-free grammars, finite automata, minimization, regular expressions, Kleene's Theorem, pumping lemmas, closure properties, nonequivalence of deterministic and non-deterministic PDA's, Turing machines and decidable and undecidable problems.</li>
          <li>Anecdote: This class is the harder version of Discrete Math. My professor was David Taylor, who decided that your grade is only determined by exams as any homework and quizzes are supposed
            to help prepare you for the exam. I think this class was the hardest as it's very abstract but the overall percentage to pass </li>

            Midway through the semester we switched classes and I remembered doing these long assignments and taking forever to get docker to work. 
            I helped out this girl named Jennifer. I was stressing out on the final but ended up with a good score.
